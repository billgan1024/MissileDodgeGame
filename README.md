# MissileDodgeGame
This is the original Missile Dodge by Bill.

I made this game in Java in Grade 7/8 when I was interested in game development. This is the first game on which I spent a significant amount of time on. 

I added my own powerups inspired from the game "Tilt to Live" and I designed about 10 levels with 4 difficulties.
