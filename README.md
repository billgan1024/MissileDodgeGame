# Missile Dodge
This is the original Missile Dodge by Bill.

I made this game in Java in Grade 7/8 when I was interested in game development. This is the first game on which I spent a significant amount of time on. 

I added my own powerups inspired from the game "Tilt to Live" and I designed about 10 levels with 4 difficulties.

## Installation
- Make sure you have Java installed.
- Go to the releases page for this project and download the zip file. 
- Unzip it into a folder and run "run.bat". Enjoy!
